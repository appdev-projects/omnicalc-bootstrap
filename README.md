# Omnicalc Bootstrap

## Standard Workflow

Please view the [Target](https://omnicalc-bootstrap-target.herokuapp.com/)

In this project we will be using Bootstrap classes to style our Omnical assignment.

 1. Set up the project: `bin/setup`
 1. Start your server with `bin/server`
 1. Navigate to your live application preview.
 1. As you work, remember to navigate to `/git` and **commit often as you work.**
 1. Run `rails grade` as often as you like to see how you are doing, but **make sure you test your app manually first to make sure it matches the target's behavior first**.

 The first part of your assignment will be to connect to the stylesheets from Bootstrap and FontAwesome.  After these have been connected, build your page with the correct HTML elements.  You can see in the public file that we have already created the HTML pages you will need to fill out.  We recommend starting with the index page and working from there.  Remember that all of these pages are just mock-ups and do not actually perform the functions; this will come later.
